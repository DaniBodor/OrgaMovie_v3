# OrgaMovie Macro

This FiJi/ImageJ macro takes any number 4D (xyzt) _\*.nd2_ image files of organoids and creates color-coded (for depth) time-lapse movies (see example below).

This macro is based on another [macro](https://github.com/DaniBodor/OrgaMovie) previously created by Bas Ponsioen and RenÃ© Overmeer, first published in _[Targeting mutant RAS in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids by combinatorial drug screening](https://elifesciences.org/articles/18489)_, (eLife 2016;5:e18489 doi: 10.7554/eLife.18489).


## How to get the macro
1) [Download](https://github.com/DaniBodor/OrgaMovie_v3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository by clicking on the link or on the green 'Code' button above and 'Download ZIP' (or use git pull).
2) Extract your zip file
3) Start FIJI and go to _Plugins>Install..._ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img align="middle" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14219087/153043733-e1f90753-01e7-4e4d-b06d-753f97aff7df.png" width=40%>

4) Select OrgaMovie_v3.ijm from the location you downloaded and unzipped to and save it into you _.../fiji.app/plugins/Analyze/_ folder (or some other location you prefer)  
5) Restart FiJi and it will show up in your _Plugins>Analyze_ menu &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img align="middle" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14219087/153043552-0d984d64-351b-4f12-bb03-4bdc5b87dfa5.png" width=50%>


## Running OrgaMovie_v3
1) Put all the raw data you want to process into a folder (images can be any size and any format that FiJi can handle)
2) Select _OrgaMovie_v3_ from wherever you installed it (or [create a shortcut](https://imagej.net/learn/keyboard-shortcuts))
3) Choose your settings (see below for explanation), hit OK
4) Choose your data input folder, hit OK
5) Your movies (and a log file) will now be saved into a subfolder called _/_OrgaMovies/_
6) If the macro finished running without errors, the last line in the log window should read "Run finished without crashing."

### Input settings
- Input filetype: write the extension of the filetype you want to use (so that all files i the input folder with a different extension are ignored).
- Input channel: set the channel to use in terms of channel order (so N<sup>th</sup> channel).
    - Can be ignored if single-channel (i.e. single-color) data is used.
    - Because false colors are used to signify depth, it is unclear how to implement multi-channel depth in this macro. Talk to me if you are interested in this to see if we can figure something out.
- Time interval: set the interval (in minutes) between consecutive frames. This is used in the time-stamp of the movie.
- Z-step: set the axial step size (in microns). This is used for the color-bar legend.

### Movie settings
- Frame rate: The frame rate of the output movie (for _\*.avi_). Set how many seconds each frame stays in view when playing the movie.
- Apply drift correction: Untick this if you do not want to correct for drift (or jitter) of your movies.
- Depth coding: select look up table (LUT) for depth coding.
- Projection LUT: select look up table (LUT) for the max projection.
- Pixel saturation: sets % of saturated pixels in output. Larger number means more saturation but also brighter images (and vice versa).
- Min intensity method: select threshold method to detect the background intensity.
- Min intensity factor: multiplication factor for background intensity. Larger number will cut off more dim signals but also generate brighter images.
- Detect crop region: select threshold method to detect the region with relevant signal.
- Crop boundary: choose how much larger the crop region should be compared to the automatically detected (this number will be added in each direction).
- Scalebar target width: select the ideal width of the scale bar in proportion to the image width. The true width of the scale bar will depend on a round number of microns that gives a scale bar of similar width to this target.

### Output settings
- Output format: Choose whether output videos should be in between _\*.avi_ or _\*.tif_ or both.
    - TIFs are easier to use for downstream analysis in ImageJ but require significantly more diskspace than AVIs (~25-50x larger files).
- Save intermediates: if this is checked, then the depth and max projections are also saved as separate \*.tifs without any legend, etc

### ImageJ settings
- Available RAM: set to 0 to automatically detect. If you notice that the macro regularly crashes due to limited RAM (you will get an error message stating this), then you can set a limit here. The log file will state what the previous limit was and you can test some lower number than that.
- Print progress duration: if checked, the log file will keep track of which process of the macro takes how long.
